Summary of 2020–21 analyses of the importance of the federal tax credit,,
,"Analyses examined characteristics associated with participants in the Clean Vehicle Rebate Project who found the tax credit extremely important in making it possible to acquire an EV -- termed ""FTC Extreme"" consumers. Characteristics were examined using descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression. Dominance analysis was performed with parsimonious versions of logistic regression models to rank-order importance of significant factors.  For an example of precursor analysis, see: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4021407",
,,
Survey Data Description,,
,"These data are from a survey of participants in the California's Clean Vehicle Rebate Project, a statewide consumer cash rebate for the purchase or lease of a qualifying clean vehicle. Participants are invited to complete the survey once their rebate application is approved, and a reminder is sent when the rebate is sent.  For more information, see cleanvehiclerebate.org",
,"Technology Types: Eligible vehicles included in the dataset are: plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Vehicles qualifying for the regulatory category BEVx receive the same incentive as BEVs. They are grouped with BEV applications and survey responses in this file. BEVx are often grouped with PHEVs in other data sources, such as the Auto Alliance's Advanced Technology Vehicle Sales Dashboard (https://autoalliance.org/energy-environment/advanced-technology-vehicle-sales-dashboard/).",
,,
Weighting and Representativeness,,
,"Proportional iterative raking was used to make the survey data more representative of the program population along the dimensions vehicle technology type, vehicle model, and county. The application data used to calculate the strata used in the weighting were filtered to exclude applications in strata for which no corresponding survey responses were collected: ",
,,
,Application data filters applied: ,
,- Fleets removed,
,"- Zero emission motorcycles, non-highway-capable neighborhood electric vehicles, and hydrogen fuel-cell electric vehicles removed",
,- Leases removed,
,- Purchases occurring outside the date range covered in the survey edition removed,
,"- Three models lacking a survey response were removed (Mercedes-Benz 250e, Honda Clarity Electric, Cadillac ELR)",
,- One county lacking a survey response removed (Lassen),
,"Note: because CVRP applicants have up to 18 months to submit an application after purchasing their vehicle, a relatively small number of additional applications may have been received after the application data were collected.",
